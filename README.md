# Analysis of Fatal Traffic Collisions in the U.S.

For this project, I wanted to identify factors that may contribute to fatal traffic collisions in the U.S. and 
determine ways to address them. I found a dataset published by the NHTSA in the bigquery-public-data library that 
contains data about vehicle collisions where there was at least one death. I chose to limit the scope of my analysis 
to the years 2017 through 2020 (the latest year available) for this project. 

The SQL file in this repository explains the steps I took to create my tables, clean and transform the data. 
After this, I imported the data into Tableau, where I analyzed it and created visualizations to showcase my findings.
